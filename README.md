##### This repository contains some of my C programming language projects at 42 Rio 


# About 42 Piscine
   
    The 42 school is a global programming institute open 24/7 where the students (also known as 'Cadets')
    are trained through peer-to-peer methodology, and project-based learning. 
    
    The first selection is made using a series of logic and memory tests on the institution's website
    intended to assess the students' abilities to learn computer science. The second selection is called
    the “piscine”, meaning "pool": an intensive four-week selection process during which the 100 applicants
    must carry out practical work in the C Language. Besides, the "pisciners" learn C, Shell and Git for submit
    the projects, it's also learnt teamwork (academic and leisure space collaboration), self learning, proactiveness,
    time management and resiliency for not "drowning" in the middle of the massive load of work demanded by the non-stop
    26-day program.


# The Projects Concepts

    # 00 - Introduction to C: functions, variables and loops
    # 01 - Strings and Arrays: print, length, swap, copy, compare characters
    # 02 - Continuing with Strings by Introducing Maths to Them: Fibonacci sequence, sqrt, factorial, prime numbers
    # 03 - Parameters from Programs: argc and argv
    # 04 - h.file: A header file (to be included with a preprocessor #include directive) with the functions
    ft_putchar.c, ft_putstr.c, ft_ft_strcmp.c, ft_strlen.c, and ft_swap


# The Exams

    There were 4 exams, one per week, the questions were sorted by level, sometimes they were equals to the projects and most of the time not :p
